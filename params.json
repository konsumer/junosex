{"name":"Junosex","body":"# Control Roland Alpha Juno 1, 2, 106 & MKS-50 with MIDI CC, instead of SysEx\r\n\r\nAll decent MIDI sequencers speak CC, but being able to speak SysEx particular to these synths is harder to come by.  This code, when placed on an ATMEGA8/168/328 will do the conversion for you, and allow your computer/ipad/sequencer to get romantic with your Juno.\r\n\r\nThe [Arduino MIDI Library] is required. I compiled the code in the Arduino IDE.\r\n\r\n## Hardware\r\n\r\nFollow the [schematic] to put it together. I will provide better instructions, later. I used [ArduinoISP] running on a [teensy] to program an [ATMEGA8]. I used a [resonator] to be cheap and lazy (rather than a crystal and 2 capacitors.)\r\n\r\nIf you are using a [cheap-o USB-to-MIDI adapter], you can open it up, and solder the wires direct to TX/RX, and use the power/ground from USB (inside adapter) to make it all simpler/cheaper.\r\n\r\nIf you want it to run on batteries, use a 9V battery and a [7805 regulator].\r\n\r\n## Modification\r\n\r\nFeel free to modify. This thing is super-simple.\r\n\r\nSome ideas:\r\n* put RGB LEDs on PWM pins, for cool light-effects when different control messages are sent\r\n* add knobs to change how CCs are interpreted, or set values directly\r\n* Attach [wireless] to it for cheap, so you can hide your computer/sequencer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ATMEGA8]: http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Atmel/ATMEGA8-16PU/?qs=7JStj%2fjQ2SHlSx6QootzDTUTMpkFcVaHHuOB6ZSDMnk%3d\r\n[resonator]: http://www.mouser.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?R=HWZT-16.00MDvirtualkey52750000virtualkey815-HWZT-16.00MD\r\n[ArduinoISP]: http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP\r\n[Arduino MIDI Library]: http://arduino.cc/playground/Main/MIDILibrary\r\n[wireless]: http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10532\r\n[teensy]: http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html\r\n[cheap-o USB-to-MIDI adapter]: https://www.google.com/search?q=midi+to+usb&tbm=shop&tbs=p_ord:p\r\n[schematic]: https://github.com/konsumer/junosex/raw/master/schematic.png\r\n[7805 regulator]: http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/ON-Semiconductor/MC7805CTG/?qs=%252b9%2fcbd0IE0RkDYggsVZtGe3PoqBzrkPO","tagline":"Make Roland Juno sysex messages from sensible MIDI CC messages.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
